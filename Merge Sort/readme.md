0.        [16,21,11,8,12,22]
                /   \
1.        [16,21,11] [8,12,22]
              / \        / \
2.        [16][21,11] [8][12,22]
            |    / \    |   / \
3.        [16][21][11] [8][12][22]
            |   \ /     |   \ /
4.        [16][11,21] [8][12,22]
              \  /       \  /
5.          [11,16,21][8,12,22]
                   \  /
6.           [8,11,12,16,21,22]
