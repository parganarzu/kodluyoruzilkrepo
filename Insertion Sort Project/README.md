### [22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

## Task 1 - Write the stages of the above sequence according to the sort type

    [22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]
    [2, 27, 16, 22, 18, 6]
    [2, 6, 16, 22, 18, 27]
    [2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]
    
## Task 2 - Write the Big-O notation

    O(n^2)
    
## Task 3 - What case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted?

    Average Case

### Quick Notes

Time Complexity: 
    
 - Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle 
 - Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end 
 - Best case: The number we are looking for is at the beginning
